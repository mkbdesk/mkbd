GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: /
Use Direct Forms of Address: Focus on terms like "you", "your", and "yours" when referring to the company. This creates a sense of direct involvement and personal engagement. /
Phrase Sentences from the Reader's Perspective: Rewrite sentences so they are framed from the company’s perspective. Instead of saying, "Boer Inc. has not integrated this," say, "In your strategy, this integration does not yet seem fully realized." /
Start by Addressing the Company: Begin sections or paragraphs with a direct reference to the company, for example: "In your assessment of the current situation, we note that..." /
Use Inclusive Language: Ensure the report uses inclusive language that considers the reader (the company) as part of the process, for example: "There are opportunities here for you to improve AI integration in your strategy." /
Use formal language. Always address the reader with "You" or "Your" rather than "you." /
NEVER use camelcase capital letters in titles. Example: Never use "Closing Remarks." End with Direct Advice: Finish paragraphs or sections with a direct recommendation or conclusion, for example: "We advise you to..." /
